            projectDescription="For this project I watched a lot of Youtube to learn Blender. It was really enjoyable and stressful. Most nights it sent my laptop into overdrive but I'm happy to have produced these pieces. They materialise a lot of my thoughts during the learning process. You can't make bricks without clay."
            preSlideContent="There is a plethora of wonderful resources out there and with todays technology you don't need to venture far. Youtube is god-tier for me and I have great respect for those who have contributed. Notable mentions to the Youtubers who paved the way for my Blender journey: @blenderguru | @blenderstudy | @cggeek"
